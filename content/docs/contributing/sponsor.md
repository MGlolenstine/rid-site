_Rid_ is _[Sponsorware](https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware)_ and thus not open sourced yet. 

You [can sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/thlorenz) via a monthly contribution and
**gain immediate access** to the currently private [_rid_](https://github.com/thlorenz/rid)
repository.

**I will fully open source _rid_ to everyone once I reach 60 sponsors**.

By sponsoring me you not only show your appreciation for all the work that went into _rid_
already, but also **help me evolve, stabilize and maintain** it.

Sponsors also receive early access to screencasts and tutorials about _rid_.

I greatly appreciate it. üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è

üëâ Please select a [tier that applies to you](https://github.com/sponsors/thlorenz) and support
_Rid_ development.
